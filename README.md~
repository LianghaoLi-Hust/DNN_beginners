# DNN_beginners
This is an implementation of autoencoders and a softmax classification based system 
all the code is based based on the tutorial: http://ufldl.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/UFLDL_Tutorial
to run the basic example you have to open demo_train_sparse_Autoencoder.m
to run the staked auto encoder exercise you have to open demo_stakedAEExercise_mnistImages.m
I'm implementing some other functions to do mappings from X domain to Y domain, and also to do the
training using parallel tools of matlab
